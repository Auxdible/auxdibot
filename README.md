# ü§ñ auxdibot

## About Project

Auxdibot is a multipurpose WIP Discord utility bot, created by Auxdible with the MERN tech stack.

### Table of Contents

`/lib` - **Discord.js & Express.js backend, using passport with passport-discord with Discord OAuth2 for authentication.**

`/app` - **React with react-router and Bootstrap frontend using axios for api requests.**

## How to Use

Auxdibot uses Discord's slash command system. If you want to run any command you must prefix it with a `/` and ensure you are running one of Auxdibot's commands.

### Basic Commands

* `/help [command] [subcommand]` - View a list of every command or information about a specific command.

* `/placeholders` - View every placeholder.

* `/user (user)` - View information about a user and enforce punishments with an easy-to-use embed.

* `/record (user)` - View a user's previous punishments.

* `/settings` - View the settings or change settings with the various slash commands on this command.

* `/permissions` - View, delete or create permission overrides for certain permissions on Auxdibot.

* `/embed` - Create or edit Discord Embeds with **ZERO** coding knowledge! Custom JSON is also supported.

* `/punishment` - View a punishment, list the latest server punishments or delete a punishment off of someone's record.

## How to Run

If you would like to run Auxdibot on your own machine:

* Go to the file where you would like the `auxdibot` file to be stored.
* Install Git and run `git clone https://github.com/Auxdible/auxdibot.git`
* Run `npm install --save` in the root `auxdibot` file
* Run `npm install --save` in the `/lib` file
* Run `npm install --save` in the `/app` file
* Run `npm run build` in the root `auxdibot` file
* The frontend build will be located at `/app/dist`
* The backend build will be located at `/lib/dist`
* Create a `.env` file in `/lib`
* Configure the `.env` file with all the parameters specified in `sample.env`
    * This step **WILL** require a MongoDB URI, Discord Bot Token, OAuth2 Client ID, and an OAuth2 Client Secret. Come up with an original or random assortment of characters for `EXPRESS_SESSION_SECRET`.
* For development, cd to the root `auxdibot` and run `npm run dev`
* For production, move the frontend build to a web server (ex. NGINX or Apache). Run the `/lib/dist/index.js` file to start the bot & express server.
